	perception related to adas(localisation mapping tracking),
		main perception tasks
		localization
		mapping
		tracking
		data fusion
		detection / clustering
		recognition / classification
		multiple task at the sametime (SLAM)

problem (merged with introduction) {separation static dynamic}
	colision risk estimation 
		TTC, probabilistic risk estimation {behavior based}
	extracting dynamic env.
		interested only in the dynamic env.
	dificulties {why is dificult?, sensors no semantics, low level representation}
		incomplete data (ref. from mathias)
		noisy data
		precision
		realtime processing
state of the art
	Other kind of separation
	DATMO

	SLAM+DATMO
	occupancy grid
implementation {how do i solve the  problem}
	grid based approach 
	general approach: env classfication + datmo
	datmo module
	env classification module
	impl with lidar

evaluation
	expedimental platform
