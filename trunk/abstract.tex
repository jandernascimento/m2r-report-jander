Occupancy Grid are refereed in several literatures as an important tool to represent the surround environment of a robot, and working along with a statistical evaluation methods (e.g. importance sampling) is possible to perform clustering and classification of certain objects, Fast Clustering and Track Algorithms(FCTA). But in certain applications we do not have infinity processing power or enough samples. Thus, acquire certitude in the results takes longer and can compromise the \textit{killer application} of the algorithm, and the appearance of new objects that need to be tracked in the scene provoke steady space explosion, in which most of the times invalidates the real applicability of the solution. So we propose a method based in Bayesian Occupancy Filter that allows segmenting the static and dynamic environment with reduced number of frames, even though capable to distinguish these two environments with an acceptable accuracy, this possibility can be applied to other proposed solution to reduce the execution time for obtaining the results from output of the sensors. The algorithm was tested in a vehicle equipped with IBEO laser scanners.
