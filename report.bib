    abstract = {{It has been shown that the dynamic environment around the mobile robot can be efficiently and robustly represented by the Bayesian occupancy filter (BOF) . In the BOF framework, the environment is decomposed into a grid based representation in which both the occupancy and the velocity distributions are estimated for each grid cell. In such a representation, concepts such as objects or tracks do not exist and the estimation is achieved at the cell level. However, the object-level representation is mandatory for applications needing high-level representations of obstacles and their motion. To achieve this, a natural approach is to perform clustering on the BOF output grid in order to extract objects. We present in this paper a novel clustering-tracking algorithm. The main idea is to use the prediction result of the tracking module as a form of feedback to the clustering module, which reduces drastically the complexity of the data association. Compared with the traditional joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) approach, the proposed algorithm demands less computational costs, so as to be suitable for environments with large amount of dynamic objects. The experiment result on the real data shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

    abstract = {{Occupancy grids are a very convenient tool for environment representation in robotics. This paper will detail a novel approach to compute occupancy grids from stereo-vision, and shows its application for the field of intelligent vehicles. In the proposed approach, occupancy is initially computed directly in the stereoscopic sensor's disparity space. The calculation formally accounts for the detection of obstacles and road pixels in disparity space, as well as partial occlusions in the scene. In a second stage, this disparity-space occupancy grid is transformed into a Cartesian space occupancy grid to be used by subsequent applications. This transformation includes spatial and temporal filtering. The proposed method is designed to be easily processed in parallel. Consequently, we chose to implement it on GPU, which allows real-time processing for the demanding application. In this paper, we present this method and we propose an application to the problem of perception in a road environment. Results are presented with real road data, comparing qualitatively this approach with others.}},

    abstract = {{Perception of and reasoning about dynamic environments is pertinent for mobile robotics and still constitutes one of the major challenges. To work in these environments, the mobile robot must perceive the environment with sensors; measurements are uncertain and normally treated within the estimation framework. Such an approach enables the mobile robot to model the dynamic environment and follow the evolution of its environment. With an internal representation of the environment, the robot is thus able to perform reasoning and make predictions to accomplish its tasks successfully. Systems for tracking the evolution of the environment have traditionally been a major component in robotics. Industries are now beginning to express interest in such technologies. One particular example is the application within the automotive industry for adaptive cruise control [Cou{\'e} et al., 2002], where the challenge is to reduce road accidents by using better collision detection sys- tems. The major requirement of such a system is a robust tracking system. Most of the existing target-tracking algorithms use an object-based represen- tation of the environment. However, these existing techniques must explicitly consider data association and occlusion. In view of these problems, a grid- based framework, the Bayesian occupancy filter (BOF) [Cou{\'e} et al., 2002, 2003], has been proposed.}},

    abstract = {{Stereo-vision is extensively used for intelligent vehicles, mainly for obstacle detection, as it provides a large amount of data. Many authors use it as a classical 3D sensor which provides a large tri-dimensional cloud of metric measurements, and apply methods usually designed for other sensors, such as clustering based on a distance. For stereo-vision, the measurement uncertainty is related to the range. For medium to long range, often necessary in the field of intelligent vehicles, this uncertainty has a significant impact, limiting the use of this kind of approaches. On the other hand, some authors consider stereo-vision more like a vision sensor and choose to directly work in the disparity space. This provides the ability to exploit the connectivity of the measurements, but roughly takes into consideration the actual size of the objects. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic representation of the specific uncertainty for stereo-vision, which takes advantage of both aspects - distance and disparity. The model is presented and then applied to obstacle detection, using the occupancy grid framework. For this purpose, a computationally-efficient implementation based on the u-disparity approach is given.}},

@article{Leonard2002Mobile,
    abstract = {{The application of the extended Kaman filter to the problem of mobile robot navigation in a known environment is presented. An algorithm for, model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is developed. The algorithm is based on an extended Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. Two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a `Robuter' mobile robot and six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s}},

    abstract = {{It has been shown that the dynamic environment around the mobile robot can be efficiently and robustly represented by the Bayesian occupancy filter (BOF) . In the BOF framework, the environment is decomposed into a grid based representation in which both the occupancy and the velocity distributions are estimated for each grid cell. In such a representation, concepts such as objects or tracks do not exist and the estimation is achieved at the cell level. However, the object-level representation is mandatory for applications needing high-level representations of obstacles and their motion. To achieve this, a natural approach is to perform clustering on the BOF output grid in order to extract objects. We present in this paper a novel clustering-tracking algorithm. The main idea is to use the prediction result of the tracking module as a form of feedback to the clustering module, which reduces drastically the complexity of the data association. Compared with the traditional joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) approach, the proposed algorithm demands less computational costs, so as to be suitable for environments with large amount of dynamic objects. The experiment result on the real data shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

The process leading to the consensus is explicitly described and the common distribution that is reached is explicitly determined. The model can also be applied to problems of reaching a consensus when the opinion of each member of the group is represented simply as a point estimate of the parameter rather than as a probability distribution.},
